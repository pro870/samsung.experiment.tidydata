samsung.experiment.tidydata
===========================

The script merge the training and testing data sets, previously splitted. It also adds the subject it corresponds to each observation. Changes the Activity label to a descriptive one, instead of just a number. Then all variables are change to a more readable friendly labels so you dont need the cookbook, at least not that often. Lastly the script summerize the data by subject, by activity for the average of each variable into a more tidy data.
